# OnCampus Master Test Case Suite + Pre-Release Playbook (Senior QA)

## 1) Quality gate and release policy

Release is allowed only when:

- All **P0** cases pass
- At least **95% of P1** cases pass (with no unresolved customer-facing regressions)
- No open security/privacy blocker
- Build + smoke + rollback validation complete

Severity model:

- **P0 (Blocker):** prevents core usage or causes data loss/revenue risk
- **P1 (High):** major flow degradation, workaround exists
- **P2 (Medium):** minor functional/UX issue
- **P3 (Low):** polish issue

---

## 6) Manual QA prompt (non-code review)

```text
You are a senior QA engineer testing a SaaS product.

IMPORTANT:
Test product behavior only.
Do not review source code.

Cover modules:
Public pages, auth, onboarding, dashboard, leads, students, courses,
batches, fees, payments, team, billing, SEO endpoints.

For each module report:
- Pass/Fail
- Edge-case behavior
- Error handling quality
- Risks

Must verify explicitly:
- Trial creation and date-based expiry
- Plan limits (Solo=1, Team=5)
- Billing upgrades and webhook effects
- OTP limits and failures
- Lead capture to CRM path

Final output:
1) Working features
2) Broken features
3) Missing features
4) Risk areas
5) Readiness score (0-100)
6) GO / NO-GO recommendation
```

---

## 7) Release workflow (dev -> main)

1. Feature branch development
2. Merge to `dev`
3. Execute full P0/P1 suite on staging
4. Fix issues and re-run impacted regression
5. Run `pnpm build`
6. Pre-prod smoke
7. Merge `dev -> main`
8. Deploy
9. Post-deploy smoke (public + auth + billing + lead capture)

Rollback policy:

- Any P0 post-release issue => rollback immediately

---

## 8) GSC indexing strategy (dynamic institute pages)

Required:

- Dynamic sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`
- Robots at `/robots.txt`
- Canonical institute path `/i/{slug}`

Discovery method:

- Submit `https://oncampus.in/sitemap.xml` once in GSC
- Ensure new onboarded slugs are auto-added to sitemap
- Re-crawl follows sitemap updates

---

## 9) Sign-off template

- Build: PASS / FAIL
- P0: PASS / FAIL
- P1: PASS / FAIL
- Billing + trial: PASS / FAIL
- SEO indexing readiness: PASS / FAIL
- Security/privacy blockers: YES / NO
